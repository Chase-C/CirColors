CirColors
================

A simple circle-circle collision simulator with a twist. Written in javascript.

[You can run it in your browser right here!](http://Chase-C.github.io/Circolors)
Just hold down the mouse button to create a circle of whatever size you want, and drag it in the direction you'd like it to travel. Make two circles collide for a chime.

I've only tested it in Firefox and Chrome, so I don't know if it will work properly in Safari, Opera, or whatever else people use.

In Chrome, the audio doesn't work quite right. There are strange jitters and artifacts. I think that it's a problem with Chrome itself, but it could be my implementation or the audio library I use, Thunder.js.
